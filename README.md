# 📌 Project Description: AI-Powered Stock Price Predictor

## 🔹 Overview:
The AI-Powered Stock Price Predictor is a machine learning-driven web application designed to forecast stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. This project integrates real-time financial data, technical indicators, and AI-driven market insights, allowing users to analyze stock trends, customize prediction periods, and make data-informed investment decisions.

## 🔹 Features & Functionality:
✅ Real-Time Stock Data Fetching

Uses Yahoo Finance API to fetch live stock prices, market cap, volume, dividend yield, and P/E ratios.
Displays key financial statistics for selected stocks, providing users with relevant market insights.
✅ Deep Learning-Based Stock Prediction

Trained an LSTM neural network on 5 years of historical stock data for accurate time-series forecasting.
Allows users to select custom prediction periods (7, 10, 15, or 30 days).
Optimized model performance using feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
✅ Explainable AI (XAI) & Technical Analysis

Implements technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Volatility) to enhance model interpretability.
Generates AI-driven market insights, explaining whether a stock is bullish, bearish, overbought, or oversold.
✅ Interactive Visualizations & UI

Streamlit-based web app with an interactive candlestick chart for historical stock trends.
Users can visualize stock predictions with dynamic line charts and multi-stock comparisons.
Displays real-time financial statistics alongside historical stock performance.
✅ Model Optimization & Deployment

Utilizes GPU acceleration for faster model training.
Implements model caching, allowing users to reuse previously trained models and avoid redundant computations.
Designed for cloud deployment on AWS, Streamlit Cloud, or Heroku.
